my-emacs-conf
=============

## Attention
This emacs.d config only for **Mac OS**, just for my daily use.

## Preparation
I do use lisp for trainning my skills, so if you want install successfully with the default config, you must install the below things.
```bash
$ brew install texinfo
$ brew link texinfo
```
Or you just can comment the code in init.el
```Emacs-Lisp
;; (require 't-cl)
```

## Install
It's easy to install like other emacs.d, the dependency will be installed automatically which is get benefit by [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get).
```bash
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/terry3/my-emacs-conf .emacs.d
$ emacs
```
